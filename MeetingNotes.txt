Oct 31, 2023 meeting notes with Erin
-- Erin is going to read the paper on SNP calling tools

Oct 25, 2023 meeting notes with Dante
-- Last week (on 10/18) Randy sent Dante and Erin a couple of papers on SNP calling tools. All three will read them before next week's meeting (check email to find papers)
-- Dante will look at https://github.com/rklabacka/ThamnophisElegans_FunctionalGenomics2021/blob/main/Examining-Sequence-Variation/reads2vcf/reads2vcf.sh to understand steps after mapping
---- These include adding readgroups and marking duplicates

October 18, 2023 meeting notes (w/ Erin, Dante, and Randy)
1. Erin is going to finish up her script to pull out the mitochondrial coordinates and create a new GFF file
2. Dante is going to add read groups, mark PCR duplicates, and index his bam reads in preparation for SNP calling
3. Erin and Dante are going to review the manuscripts "Liu et al (2022) and Barbitoff et al (2022)", each of which compare SNP calling software tools

Oct 4, 2023 meeting notes (w/ Erin, Dante, and Randy)
1. Erin is going to modify search criteria to only include symbols and to add '|' before and '_HUMAN' after (i.e., get rid of description as search term)
2. Dante is going to trim and map raw reads to the arizonae and marmoratus genomes
-- Use trimmomatic to clean the reads: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic
-- This will give you exposure to a new tool, and I think it is a bit more straightforward than fastp
-- I just uploaded annotated reference genomes for Aspidoscelis marmoratus and Aspidoscelis arizonae to the lonepeak cluster under /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/whiptail_nmt_variation_data/references
-- I also added the raw Illumina read data to /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/whiptail_nmt_variation_data/raw_reads
-- We need to map these reads to the annotated reference genomes
-- I know this makes things more complex- but I would like to map all reads to both genomes
-- In other words, let's make the following directories:
-- /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/whiptail_nmt_variation_data/reads_mapped_to_arizonae
-- /scratch/general/nfs1/utu_4310/whiptail_nmt_variation_data/reads_mapped_to_marmoratus

Sep 20, 2023 meeting notes (w/ Erin, Dante, and Randy)
1. Erin will work on python script to search gff for Nmt genes
- Try first without regular expressions
- After you get this working, look into regular expressions (see videos below from Sep 13 meeting)

Sep 13, 2023 Meeting notes (w/ Erin, Dante, and Randy)
1. Erin will create python script to search gff for Nmt genes

Aug 22, 2023 Meeting notes (w/ Dante and Randy)
For this project, you will be working with the same clean data from the NGS_mapping_and_phylodist repository, but now it needs to be mapped to the annotated A. marmoratus genome. The fasta and gff file for the marmoratus genome are located within the directory /scratch/general/nfs1/utu/whiptail_refs on lonepeak (a cluster on the CHPC).
