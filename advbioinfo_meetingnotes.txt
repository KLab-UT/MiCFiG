What We Did:
Worked on setting up work for Alex & David to do on the project
Got blast_script.sh working(?) - Reagan is runnning it on the actual project data

David = Follow the outline for filter_blast_results
    Take the blast results and find the start and stop points for each chromosome match
        Minimum start point and maximum stop point
	

Alex = filter.gff
